# Galaxy Morphology Recognition
Testing some methods for recognize the morphology of a galaxy, based only on the images.

The dataset used is https://www.astromatic.net/projects/efigi, where some features are extracted using the handsonbow code https://sites.google.com/site/handsonbow/downloads ore using the MATLAB tutorials for extracting features from CNN.

This project is part of the Computer Vision course that I'm taking.
